A for loop is a programming language statement which allows code to be repeatedly executed.

The syntax is

for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
    <statement>
expression_1 is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling the terminating flag for the loop.
expression_2 is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.
expression_3 is generally used to update the flags/variables.
A sample loop is

for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ...
}
In this challenge, you will use a for loop to increment a variable through a range.

Input Format

You will be given two positive integers,  and  (), separated by a newline.

Output Format

For each integer  in the inclusive interval :

If , then print the English representation of it in lowercase. That is "one" for , "two" for , and so on.
Else if  and it is an even number, then print "even".
Else if  and it is an odd number, then print "odd".
Note: 

Sample Input

8
11

Sample Output

eight
nine
even
odd



The Answer of this question is here


Problem Statement:
You are given two positive integers, a and b. For each integer i in the inclusive interval between a and b, you need to perform the following actions:

If i is between 1 and 9 (inclusive), print the English representation of i in lowercase. For example, "one" for 1, "two" for 2, and so on.
If i is greater than 9 and it's an even number, print "even."
If i is greater than 9 and it's an odd number, print "odd."
Step 1: Input
We start by getting input values for a and b from the user. This can be done using the cin stream.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    // Rest of the code will go here

    return 0;
}


In the code above, we declare two integer variables a and b to store the input values.

Step 2: Process the Range
Next, we need to loop through the inclusive range from a to b and perform the required actions for each integer in that range. We'll use a for loop for this purpose.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    // Loop through the range from 'a' to 'b'
    for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) {
        // Perform actions here
    }

    return 0;
}



Step 3: Determine and Print the Output
Inside the loop, we'll determine the output for each value of i according to the problem statement and print it.



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    // English representations of numbers 1 to 9
    string numbers[] = {"one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"};

    // Loop through the range from 'a' to 'b'
    for (int i = a; i <= b; i++) {
        if (1 <= i && i <= 9) {
            // 'i' is between 1 and 9, print the English representation
            cout << numbers[i - 1] << endl;
        } else if (i > 9 && i % 2 == 0) {
            // 'i' is greater than 9 and even
            cout << "even" << endl;
        } else if (i > 9 && i % 2 != 0) {
            // 'i' is greater than 9 and odd
            cout << "odd" << endl;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}


In the code above, we declare an array of strings called numbers, which stores the English representations of numbers from 1 to 9. Inside the loop, we check the value of i and print the appropriate output based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Step 4: Compile and Run
You can compile this C++ program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) and then run the executable. Make sure to provide the input values for a and b when prompted, and the program will produce the desired output.

Here's an example of how the program would work:


Input:
2
7

Output:
two
three
four
five
six
seven
